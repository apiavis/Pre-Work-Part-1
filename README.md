# Teletype-Pre-Work-Part-1
This project is a reflection of my attempt to recreate a prototype from the ground up using only HTML5 and CSS.  The project was built using the Google Chrome web browser.  When I was nearing the end of the project and attempted to open the HTML file in Microsoft Edge, I came to the realization that this particular browser does not recognize the text-align CSS function.  The structure and formatting is better reflected in the Google Chrome browser.  In addition, the project was built on a large, 24" monitor, which makes the image appear to have the same margins and padding as the prototype that I was provided with.  When the image is opened on a small monitor or screen, the margins look a bit different.
